# Realtor-Website
Website created for an established realtor using ReactJS and Express.

This website is designed for my client, a real estate agent and rental property investor, to provide a seamless experience for all his customers. My goal was to create a unique and resourceful platform that offers everything the client needs in one place.

## Features

- Property listings with high-quality images and detailed information
- Contact form to connect with the agent directly and schedule a viewing
- Resources section with articles and guides for rental property investing
- Blog-like section to keep customers updated on industry news and trends

## Technology Used

We used the following technologies to develop this website:

- **ReactJS** for the structure and content of the website
- **CSS3** for the styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for the advanced search functionality and other interactive elements
- **ExpressJS** for the server-side scripting and form processing

## Future Enhancements

I am constantly working to improve the website and make it even more valuable for my client and his customers.
